#explaining the pattern of missing data:
#the cleaned probability data has 55 records showing 55 different species, 
#while the cleaned duration and rate data has only 41 records of species.
#when the three tibbles are merged, there must be 14 missing data in Duration and Rate column,
#because the data only consist for 41 species compared to 55 species in probability data

#pattern observation: there is negative relationship between distance and each variable,
